🚀 Excited to share my Calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This project helped me stay engaged with hands-on practice and motivated me to work on more projects as I continue learning. 💻

🔍 What I learned:
<ul>
  <li>✅ Building a simple UI with hover interactions</li>
 <li>✅ Performing basic mathematical operations using JavaScript</li>
 <li>✅ Using try–catch for basic error handling (new concept learned!)</li>
</ul>

Every small project helps me strengthen my fundamentals and move forward in my front-end development journey.🔥
